CIS22C
Spring 2014
======

Hello! This is a repository of all the programming assignments for CIS 22C Data Abstractions and Structures taught at De Anza College by Clare Nguyen. The code I've put up might not make sense without context of the assignment (I might add that later), but you're free to examine and learn from the code. However, I do not condone cheating or plagarism and I will not be held liable for any derivatives of my work. This repo is simply for my learning on how to use git and to have a centralized place to reference my old homework. Thanks for reading.
