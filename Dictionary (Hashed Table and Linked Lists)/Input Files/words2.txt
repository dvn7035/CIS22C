and seventeen years later i did go to college
but i naively chose a college that was almost 
as expensive as stanford
and all of my working class parents' savings 
were being spent on my college tuition
after six months i couldn't see the value in it
i had no idea what i wanted to do with my life 
and no idea how college was going to help me 
figure it out
and here I was spending all of the money my parents 
had saved their entire life
so i decided to drop out and trust that it would 
all work out ok
it was pretty scary at the time
but looking back it was one of the best decisions 
i ever made
the minute i dropped out i could stop taking the 
required classes that didn't interest me
and begin dropping in on the ones that looked interesting
